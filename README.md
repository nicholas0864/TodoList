# TODO List App

## Description
This is a command-line TODO list application written in C# that allows users to manage multiple lists, add tasks with difficulty ratings, mark them as complete, edit tasks, and remove them. The data is stored in JSON files for persistence.

## Features
- Manage multiple TODO lists (e.g., Work, Personal)
- Add tasks with difficulty levels (1-5)
- Mark tasks as completed
- Edit or remove tasks
- Data persistence using JSON

## Future Plans
I plan to turn this command-line application into a full-fledged desktop application. To achieve this, I will:
- Use **.NET MAUI** or **WinForms** for a graphical user interface
- Implement a **database** (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL) for better data management
- Add **notifications** and **reminders** for tasks
- Integrate **cloud synchronization** for cross-device accessibility
- Improve UI/UX with a clean and intuitive design

## Technologies Used
- C#
- .NET
- JSON for data storage
- Potential future use of .NET MAUI/WinForms, SQLite/PostgreSQL

Stay tuned for updates as I develop this into a fully functional desktop application! ðŸš€
